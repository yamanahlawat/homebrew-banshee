# `banshee` and `banshee-mcp-shim` on the PATH are a wrapper, written by
# `postflight_steps`. macOS kills a quarantined binary with no message at all,
# so a person whose Banshee arrived through Homebrew sees a command that exits
# and says nothing. The wrapper says what happened instead, and offers to clear
# the flag when a person is there to ask.

    <<~EOS
      Banshee is signed but not yet notarised, so macOS refuses the downloaded app.
      Clear the flag, and again after each upgrade, because Homebrew marks every
      download:
        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine #{appdir}/Banshee.app
      The banshee command offers to do it for you the next time you run it.
